A very rudimentary game of snake, built using C++ using Visual Studio and the open-source SFML graphics library. <br/>
This project is my final project for an introductory Programming with C++ course.<br/>

The controls are: <br/>
~ W - move up <br/>
~ A - move left <br/>
~ S - move down <br/>
~ D - move right <br/>

The game will start quickly once the program is run, so be ready!
